# üèõÔ∏è FBR E-Invoicing System - Updated Guide

## üìã **Overview**

The FBR e-invoicing system has been completely redesigned to use **invoice numbers** instead of client selection, ensuring each invoice is unique and preventing duplicate submissions to FBR.

## üì± **Frontend Integration Guide**

### **1. Updated FBR E-Invoicing Page**

Replace the "Select Client" dropdown with:

```javascript
// Fetch available invoice numbers
const fetchAvailableInvoices = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/fbrinvoices/available-invoices');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.invoices;
};

// Invoice number dropdown
<select onChange={handleInvoiceNumberChange}>
  <option value="">Select Invoice Number</option>
  {availableInvoices.map(invoice => (
    <option key={invoice.invoiceNumber} value={invoice.invoiceNumber}>
      {invoice.invoiceNumber} - {invoice.buyerName} - Rs. {invoice.totalAmount}
    </option>
  ))}
</select>
```

### **2. Auto-Fetch Invoice Data**

```javascript
const handleInvoiceNumberChange = async (invoiceNumber) => {
  if (!invoiceNumber) return;
  
  const response = await fetch(`/api/fbrinvoices/invoice/${invoiceNumber}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  
  if (data.success) {
    // Auto-populate form fields
    setFormData({
      totalAmount: data.invoice.totalAmount,
      salesTax: data.invoice.salesTax,
      extraTax: data.invoice.extraTax,
      items: data.invoice.items, // Already includes HS codes
      buyerName: data.invoice.buyerName,
      sellerName: data.invoice.sellerName
    });
  }
};
```

### **3. FBR Submission**

```javascript
const submitToFBR = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/fbrinvoices/create-from-invoice', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      invoiceNumber: selectedInvoiceNumber,
      sandbox: false // or true for testing
    })
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  
  if (result.success) {
    alert(`FBR Invoice submitted successfully! Reference: ${result.fbrReference}`);
  }
};
```

### **4. Generate FBR Invoice PDF**

```javascript
const generateFBRInvoice = async (invoiceNumber) => {
  // Open PDF in new window
  window.open(`/api/fbrinvoices/generate-pdf/${invoiceNumber}`, '_blank');
};
```
